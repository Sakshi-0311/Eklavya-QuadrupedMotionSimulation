Creep Satbility:

The creep gait is “potentially” very stable, since 3 legs form a stable support tripod whenever any one leg is suspended. The simple idea behind the generation of this gait is tp keep the Center of Gravity(CoG) of quadruped inside the triangle formed by the three supporting legs at any given time.

Simple Creep Gait Steps:

1. The starting position, with two legs extended out on one side, and the other two legs pulled inward.
2. The top-right leg lifts up and reaches out, far ahead of the robot.
3. All the legs shift backward, moving the body forward.
4. The back-left leg lifts and steps forward alongside the body. This position is the mirror image of the starting position.
5. The top-left leg lifts and reaches out, far ahead of the robot.
6. Again, all the legs shift backward, moving the body forward.
7. The back-right leg lifts and steps back into the body, bringing us back to the starting position.
