## Forward Kinematics :
> Forward kinematics refers to the
> use of the kinematic equations of a robot 
> to compute the position of the end-effector 
> from specified values for the joint parameters.

## Inverse Kinematics :
> Inverse kinematics is a method that helps
> define the motion of a robot to reach a desired location.
