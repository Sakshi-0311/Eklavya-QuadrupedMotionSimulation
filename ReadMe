QUADRUPED MOTION SIMULATION:

The project is about modelling a 4-legged robot which can walk. Here we are using a Dog Shaped Quadruped Robot.

Simulation:
We are using CoppeliaSim(V-rep) software for simulation of our model. We are using the model (Name- Roller Walker) provided by the software. 

Main three sections regarding the study of Quadrupeds:
1.) Forward and Inverse Kinematics
2.) Gait Generation
3.) Coding
