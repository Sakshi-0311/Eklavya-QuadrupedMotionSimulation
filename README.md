# Quadruped Motion Simulation

The project is about modelling a 4-legged robot which can move forward. The project uses A Dog-Shaped Quadruped Model.

### Forward Kinematics:

Forward kinematics refers to the use of the kinematic equations of a robot to compute the position of the end-effector from specified values for the joint parameters.
